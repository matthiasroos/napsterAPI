# napsterAPI

API to fetch data from Napster music streaming (by Rhapsody International Inc.) using Python

## Description

It's only a simple Jupyter Notebook containing an implementation to access the API and retrieve and process some information.
The analysis was made for my personal use, as some tracks were marked as "not streamable" and therefore vanished from my Favorites.
